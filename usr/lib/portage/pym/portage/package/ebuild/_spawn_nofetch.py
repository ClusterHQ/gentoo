	This spawns pkg_nofetch if appropriate. The settings parameter
	is useful only if setcpv has already been called in order
	to cache metadata. It will be cloned internally, in order to
	prevent any changes from interfering with the calling code.
	If settings is None then a suitable config instance will be
	acquired from the given portdbapi instance. Do not use the
	settings parameter unless setcpv has been called on the given
	instance, since otherwise it's possible to trigger issues like
	bug #408817 due to fragile assumptions involving the config
	state inside doebuild_environment().

	A private PORTAGE_BUILDDIR will be created and cleaned up, in
	order to avoid any interference with any other processes.
	If PORTAGE_TMPDIR is writable, that will be used, otherwise
	the default directory for the tempfile module will be used.

	We only call the pkg_nofetch phase if either RESTRICT=fetch
	is set or the package has explicitly overridden the default
	pkg_nofetch implementation. This allows specialized messages
	to be displayed for problematic packages even though they do
	not set RESTRICT=fetch (bug #336499).

	This function does nothing if the PORTAGE_PARALLEL_FETCHONLY
	variable is set in the config instance.
