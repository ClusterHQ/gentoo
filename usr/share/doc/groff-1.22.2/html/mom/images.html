<h2 id="images-intro" class="docs">Introduction to inserting images and graphics</h2>

<p>
In order to include images in mom documents, the images must be in
either PDF (.pdf) or EPS (.eps) format.  Each format requires its own
macro, but both take the same arguments, and in the same order.
</p>

<p>
Please note that there are differences in the way the files
containing PDF and EPS images must be processed, hence documents may
not contain a mix.
</p>

<h3 id=converting class="docs">Image conversion and file processing</h3>

<p>
When your image files are not in PDF or EPS format&mdash;jpgs,
for example&mdash;you must convert them before including them in
a mom document.  Any utility for converting images may used.  The
ImageMagick suite of programmes, present on most GNU/Linux
systems, contains <b>convert</b>, which is simple and effective.
</p>

<h4 id="pdf" class="docs">PDF</h4>

<p>
Assuming a jpg image, conversion to PDF is done like this:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  convert &lt;image&gt;.jpg &lt;image&gt;.pdf
</span>
Any image type supported by <b>convert</b> may be converted this
way.
</p>

<p>
Mom files containing PDF images must be processed using
groff&#8217;s pdf driver.  Use of
<a href="using.html#pdfmom" style="font-weight: bold">pdfmom</a>
is strongly recommended, which natively invokes the pdf driver.
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  pdfmom doc.mom &gt; doc.pdf
</span>
</p>

<h4 id="eps" class="docs">EPS</h4>

<p>
Assuming a jpg image, conversion to EPS is done like this:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  convert &lt;image&gt;.jpg &lt;image&gt;.eps
</span>
Any image type supported by <b>convert</b> may be converted this
way.  There have been reports of trouble with PostScript level 2
images, so don&#8217;t save your images in this format.
</p>

<p>
Mom files containing EPS images must be processed using
groff&#8217;s postscript driver.  Use of
<a href="using.html#pdfmom" style="font-weight: bold">pdfmom</a>,
which can be told to use the postscript driver, is strongly
recommended.

and
<span style="font-style: normal">
<kbd>&lt;vertical adjustment&gt;</kbd></span>
require a
<a href="definitions.html#unitofmeasure">unit of measure</a>
</p>

<p>
Unlike
<a href="#pspic">PSPIC</a>,
which it resembles, PDF_IMAGE requires that the pdf image&#8217;s
dimensions (the bounding box,
<a href="#bounding-box">see below</a>)
be supplied each time it&#8217;s called.
</p>

<p>
The first optional argument tells mom how to align the image
horizontally, with <kbd>-L</kbd>, <kbd>-C</kbd>, and <kbd>-R</kbd>
standing for left, centre and right respectively.  If you need more
precise placement, the <kbd>-I</kbd> argument allows you to give an
indent from the left margin.  Thus, to indent a PDF image 6
<a href="definitions.html#picaspoints">picas</a>
from the left margin
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .PDF_IMAGE -I 6P &lt;remaining arguments&gt;
</span>
If you omit the first argument, the image will be centred.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>&lt;pdf image&gt;</kbd> must be in PDF format, with a .pdf
extension.  If it is not, mom will abort with a message.  See <a
href="#pdf">here</a> for instructions on converting image formats to
PDF.
</p>

<p id="bounding-box">
<kbd>&lt;width&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;height&gt;</kbd> are the
dimensions of the image&#8217;s bounding box.  The most reliable way
of getting the bounding box is with the utility, <strong>pdfinfo</strong>:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  pdfinfo &lt;image.pdf&gt; | grep "Page *size"
</span>
This will spit out a line that looks like this:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  Page size:      width x height pts
</span>
<kbd>pts</kbd> means
<a href="definitions.html#picaspoints">points</a>,
therefore the unit of measure appended to <kbd>&lt;width&gt;</kbd>
and <kbd>&lt;height&gt;</kbd> must be <kbd>p</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
The optional <kbd>SCALE</kbd> argument allows you to scale the image
by <kbd>&lt;factor&gt;</kbd>.  The factor is a percentage of the
image&#8217;s original dimensions, thus
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
 SCALE 50
</span>
scales the image to 50 percent of its original size.  No percent
sign or unit of measure should be appended.
</p>

<p>
The final optional argument is the vertical adjustment to apply to
the image.  A plus value raises the image
<span style="font-style: italic">within the space allotted for it</span>;
a negative value lowers it.  The value must have a unit of measure
appended.
</p>

<p>
Remember that mom files with embedded PDF images must be processed
with
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
 pdfmom doc.mom &gt; doc.pdf
</span>
</p>

<div class="box-tip">
<p class="tip-top">
<span class="note">Note:</span>
Mom automatically applies shimming after PDF_IMAGE.  See
<a href="docprocessing.html#shim">SHIM</a>
for a discussion of shimming, and how to disable it.
<p>

<p>
<span class="note">Additional note:</span>
Mom treats single, discrete images inserted into a document with
PDF_IMAGE somewhat like
<a href="#floats-intro">floats</a>,
which is to say that if an image doesn&#8217;t fit on the output
page, she will defer it to the top of the next page while continuing
to process
<a href="definitions.html#running">running text</a>.
<kbd>ADJUST</kbd> is ignored whenever an image is deferred, and a
message is printed to stderr advising you where the deferment has
taken place.
</p>

<p class="tip-bottom">
However, if more than one image does not fit on the output page,
mom defers only the first; the remainder are silently ignored.
Therefore, if you insert several images close together in the text,
it is highly recommended that you wrap the images in floats, which
do not have this restriction.

Macro: <b>PSPIC</b> <kbd class="macro-args">[ -L | -R | -I &lt;n&gt; ] &lt;file&gt; [ width [ height ] ]</kbd>
</div>

<p>
PSPIC is not actually part of mom, but rather a macro included with
every groff installation.  Although its arguments are identical to
PDF_IMAGE (except for <kbd>SCALE</kbd> and <kbd>ADJUST</kbd>, which
are missing), its behaviour is slightly different.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>man groff_tmac</kbd> contains the documentation for PSPIC, but
I&#8217;ll repeat it here with a few modifications for clarity.
</p>

<div class="examples-container">
<h3 id="groff-tmac" class="docs" style="margin-top: .5em;">From <span style="text-transform: none">groff_tmac</span></h3>
<p style="margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em;">
<kbd>&lt;file&gt;</kbd> is the name of the file containing the
image; <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> give the desired
width and height of the image as you wish it to appear within the
document.  The width and height arguments may have
<a href="definitions.html#unitofmeasure">units of measure</a>
attached; the default unit of measure is
<kbd>i</kbd>.  PSPIC will scale the graphic
uniformly in the x and y directions so that it is no more than
<kbd>width</kbd> wide and <kbd>height</kbd> high.  By default, the
graphic will be horizontally centred.  The <kbd>-L</kbd> and
<kbd>-R</kbd> options cause the graphic to be left-aligned and
right-aligned, respectively.  The <kbd>-I</kbd> option causes
the graphic to be indented by <kbd>&lt;n&gt;</kbd>;  the default unit of
measure is <kbd>m</kbd>
(<a href="definitions.html#em">ems</a>).
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is not necessary to pass PSPIC the
<kbd>&lt;width&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;height&gt;</kbd> arguments unless
you are scaling the image, in which case you will most likely need
the original dimensions of the EPS image&#8217;s bounding box.
These can be found with
<span class="pre-in-pp">
 gs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox &lt;image file&gt;.pdf 2&gt;&amp;1 \
 | grep "%%BoundingBox" | cut -d " " -f4,5
</span>
The two digits returned are in
<a href="definitions.html#picaspoints">points</a>,
therefore the
<a href="definitions.html#unitofmeasure">unit of measure</a>
<kbd>p</kbd> must be appended to them.
</p>

<p>
Because PSPIC lacks the <kbd>ADJUST</kbd> option offered by
<a href="#pdf-image">PDF_IMAGE</a>
a certain amount of manual tweaking of the vertical placement of the
image will probably be required, typically by using the
<a href="typesetting.html#ald">ALD</a>
and
<a href="typesetting.html#rld">RLD</a>
macros.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, EPS images inserted into
<a href="definitions.html#running">running text</a>
will almost certainly disrupt the baseline placement of running
text.  In order to get mom back on track after
invoking <kbd>.PSPIC</kbd>, I strongly recommend using the
<a href="docprocessing.html#shim">SHIM</a>
macro so that the bottom margin of running text falls where it
should.  Please note that with PDF_IMAGE, this is not necessary.

<h2 id="floats-intro" class="docs">Introduction to floats</h2>

<p>
Images and graphics (including those created with
<strong>tbl</strong> and <strong>pic</strong>) sometimes do not
fit on the output page of a PDF or PostScript document at the
place they&#8217;re inserted in the input file.  It&#8217;s
necessary, therefore, to defer them to the next page while carrying
on with
<a href="definitions.html#running">running text</a>.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you need this functionality (tables, for example, generally
need only appear near related text, not at a precise location), mom
provides the FLOAT macro.
</p>

<p>
Floats are usually used for images and graphics, but can contain
anything you like, including text.  Whatever&#8217;s in the
float will be kept together as a block, output immediately if
there&#8217;s room, or deferred to the top of the next output page
when there isn&#8217;t; running text continues to the bottom of the
previous page without interruption.
</p>

<p>
In the case of a float that doesn&#8217;t fit being followed by
one that does, the second is output in position and the first is
deferred.  In the case of two or more that don&#8217;t fit, they are
output in order on the next page.
</p>

<p>
A key distinction between a float and a
<a href="docelement.html#quote">QUOTE</a>
or
<a href="docelement.html#blockquote">BLOCKQUOTE</a>
is that while a float keeps everything together and defers output if
necessary, quotes and blockquotes are output immediately, and may
start on one page and finish on the next.
</p>

<p>
Floats always deposit a break before they begin, which means the
line beforehand will not be
<a href="definitions.html#filled">filled</a>.
Floats, therefore, cannot be inserted in the middle of a paragraph
without studying the output file and determining where to break or
<a href="typesetting.html#spread">spread</a>
the line before the float.
</p>

<p id="float-spacing">
Floats begin on the baseline immediately below the running text
preceding them.  No additional whitespace surrounds them, above or
below.  Running text below a float is, however,
<a href="docprocessing.html#shim">shimmed</a>,
unless shimming has been disabled with <kbd>.NO_SHIM</kbd>.  This
usually results in a small amount of extra whitespace after the
float.  The <kbd>ADJUST</kbd> argument to FLOAT allows you to
fine-tune the vertical centering.
</p>

<p>
If you&#8217;d like more space around a float, you must add it
manually, for example with 
<a href="typesetting.html#ald">ALD</a>
or
<a href="typesetting.html#space">SPACE</a>.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: -.5em">
To begin a float, simply invoke <kbd>.FLOAT</kbd> and follow it with
whatever you want the float to contain.  When you&#8217;re done,
invoke <kbd>.FLOAT&nbsp;OFF</kbd> (or <kbd>QUIT, END, X</kbd>, etc).
</p>

<p>
The optional <kbd>FORCE</kbd> argument instructs mom to output
the float exactly where it occurs in the input file.  With
<kbd>FORCE</kbd>, mom immediately breaks to a new page to output
the float if it does not fit on the current page.  While this is
somewhat contrary to the notion of floats (ie that running text
should continue to fill the page), there are circumstances where it
may be desirable.
</p>

<p>
The <kbd>ADJUST</kbd> argument tells mom to raise
(<kbd>+</kbd>) or lower (<kbd>-</kbd>) the float <i>within the space
allotted to it</i> by the specified amount.
<kbd>&lt;amount&gt;</kbd> must have a
<a href="definitions.html#unitofmeasure">unit of measure</a>
appended.  <kbd>ADJUST</kbd> gives you precise control over
the vertical centering of floats, allowing you to compensate for
unequal spacing that may result of from the automatic shimming of
floats (or the absence thereof).  See
<a href="docprocessing.html#shim">SHIM</a>
for a discussion of automatic shimming.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>ADJUST</kbd> is ignored whenever a float is deferred to
the following page.
</p>

<div class="box-tip">
<p class="tip-top">
<span class="note">Note:</span>
Floats use

Boxed tables don&#8217;t play nice with FLOAT, and require that you
