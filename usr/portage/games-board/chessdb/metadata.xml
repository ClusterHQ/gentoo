ChessDB is a free chess database which can be used on Microsoft Windows, Linux,
Apple Macs running OS X, FreeBSD, as well as most if not all modern UNIX
versions.
The program has translations into English, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, French,
German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian
and Swedish. The documentation is excellent, although currently most is
only in English, but this situation is changing rapidly. 
ChessDB is based very heavily on the highly successful Scid which was the
premier free chess database. There are a large number of features. in ChessDB.
It is not a cut-down/light/crippled (call it what you want) version of an
expensive commercial product, but you get a complete fully functional program.
