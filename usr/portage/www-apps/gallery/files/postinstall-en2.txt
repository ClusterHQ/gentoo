For new installations:

1. Create a directory to share photos and make it writeable by the web server.

2. Create a database for Gallery 2.
	MySQL: 	mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2
		mysql gallery2 -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery2.* TO
		username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'"
	PostgreSQL:	createdb gallery2 -E UNICODE
		if that doesn't work, try
		createdb gallery2 -E SQL_ASCII
			if that doesn't work either, try
			createdb gallery2

3. Now browse to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install

NOTE: The installer may complain that FfmpegToolkit.class has been modified.
This is normal, as we patch it to fix a bug with newer versions of ffmpeg.

For upgrades:

1. Copy over your config.php and the g2data directory.

2. If you are using a PHP accelerator, flush its cache.

3. Browse to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/upgrade and follow the
	instructions.
