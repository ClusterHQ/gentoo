    Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl which aims to bring
    the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text
    file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are
    saved automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a
    non-existing page. Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that
    gives it the look and feel of an outliner. This tool is intended to keep
    track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book.
