.TH SYSLOGD-LISTFILES 8 "1 January 1998" "Debian project" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH NAME
syslogd-listfiles \- list system logfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syslogd-listfiles
.RB [ " \-a " | " \-\-all " ]
.RB [ " \-\-auth " ] 
.RB [ " \-f "
.I config file
]
.RB [ " \-\-news " ]
.RB [ " \-w " | " \-\-weekly " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Sysklogd
provides a modern mechanism to log system messages.  This mechanism is
controlled by the file
.IR /etc/syslog.conf .
Messages are divided into logfiles which can grow quite big.
Therefore the logfiles need to be rotated once per day, per week or
per month.  On a Debian GNU/Linux system most of the files are rotated
once per week.

This program helps the rotation script to determine which logfiles
need to be rotated and when.  It takes care of news logfiles that are
handled by the
.B news.daily
script from INN.  In conjunction with the scripts in
.IR /etc/cron.daily " and " /etc/cron.weekly
it takes care of files with sensitive information.

By default a list of files for daily rotation is generated.  At the
moment this option only reflects entries that contain "*.*" as
facility.priority.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-a" ", " "\-\-all"
List all logfiles and ignore all other rules.

.IR /etc/syslog.conf ","

containing auth.*.
