		The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It lets you set up
		HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing the responses coming back, all
		from within the comforts of Haskell. It's dependent on the network package to operate,
		but other than that, the implementation is all written in Haskell.
