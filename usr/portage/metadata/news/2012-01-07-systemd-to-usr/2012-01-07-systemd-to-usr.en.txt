We have decided to move our systemd installation into /usr prefix.
After the upgrade, the main systemd executable will be installed
as /usr/bin/systemd and the unit files will be installed
to /usr/lib/systemd; however, systemd will still look for unit files
in the /lib location.

For this reason, new revisions of all systemd versions have been added
to the tree and all users are advised to upgrade ASAP to make
the transition as painless as possible. To achieve that, the following
steps have been taken:

1) the new systemd versions install and enable a path monitoring helper
which automatically updates /etc/systemd symlinks when unit files
are moved from /lib to /usr/lib;

2) the systemd.eclass blocks older versions of systemd to ensure that
the service files aren't installed in the new location before the helper
service is in place;

3) a symlink is installed at /bin/systemd to ensure that current init=
specifications are still valid.

Please note that these features will be removed after the transitional
period and users upgrading afterwards will have to manually ensure
correctness of their installations. The former two features will be
removed on 2012-03-01, the last one on 2012-05-01.

Users are advised to rebuild the packages providing systemd units
and update their kernel command lines before those deadlines.
