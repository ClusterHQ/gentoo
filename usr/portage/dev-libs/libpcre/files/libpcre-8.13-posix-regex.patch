 A user pointed out that PCRE was rejecting [:a[:digit:]] whereas Perl was not.
 It seems that the appearance of a nested POSIX class supersedes an apparent
 external class. For example, [:a[:digit:]b:] matches "a", "b", ":", or
-a digit. Also, unescaped square brackets may also appear as part of class
-names. For example, [:a[:abc]b:] gives unknown class "[:abc]b:]"in Perl.
