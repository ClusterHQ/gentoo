  Thing is, one really should not link against both libthread and
  libpthread, but use '-pthread' gcc-flag or '-mt' suncc-flag instead.

  Don't know where glib-folks have information from found in that
  comment.

* Fabian Groffen
  patch both configure and configure.in (in the right order) such that a
  sudden autoreconf doesn't wipe out our changes.

Multiple reports for these, but unfortunately all ignored/unfixed, e.g.:
