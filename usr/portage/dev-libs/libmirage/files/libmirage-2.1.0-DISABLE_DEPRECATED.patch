Subject: [PATCH] All: Stop defining G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

Defining G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is a bad idea. For one it means deprecated
functions etc. is effectively removed by the preprocessor. This breaks
compilation on certain setups (read: Launchpad compiler farm), since
the functions are not declared and therefore you get warnings about
the calls being implicit. And on setups that compiles the code, the
resulting code might result in undefined behaviour, in particular on
64-bit platforms.

Note that on supported compilers such as GCC, you will still get warnings
about calling deprecated functions without this define in place.
