An intermediate "install" to the build dir is used with slibdir=/
causing install_names to be recorded for /libgcc_s.1.dylib, which are
obviously wrong.  Avoid this from happening by hard-assigning
shlib_slibdir with the correct value, such that even though the library
is installed into the build dir (offsetted at /), it's install_name is
still set to something which is correct afterwards.
