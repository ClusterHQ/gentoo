*ahem-1.0 (23 May 2014)

  23 May 2014; Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> +ahem-1.0.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  One off entry to support testsuite requirements of weasyprint. The tarball was
  specially prepared by upstream devs of that package. It will have no further
  development, thus no version bumps
