Function, CPFunction, CPPFunction and VFunction typedefs are considered
old-style (deprecated) starting from readline 4.2.
Compatibility typedefs have been in place up to readline 6.2 but were
removed with the 6.3 release thus causing builds to break.
Swtich to the new-style specific prototyped typedef.
