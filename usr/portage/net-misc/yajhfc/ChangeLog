*yajhfc-0.5.2 (02 Jul 2012)

  02 Jul 2012; Matthew Marlowe <mattm@gentoo.org> +yajhfc-0.5.2.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  First commit of user submitted ebuild to fix Bug 353041 - new package:
  net-misc/yajhfc. Another client for hylafax plus server. Java based. Ebuild
  meets initial tests and package solves a problem that other gentoo packages
  do not. Still, further work will probably be needed to get this ebuild
  optimal.. Initial release is package masked.
