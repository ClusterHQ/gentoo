+.TH CUTTER 8 "April, 2005"
+.SH NAME
+cutter \- cut tcp/ip connections
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B cutter
+.IR ipaddress1 \ [ \ port1 \ [ \ ipaddress2 \ [ \ port2 
+\ ] \ ] \ ]
+.br
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B Cutter
+is an open source program that allows Linux firewall
+administrators to abort TCP/IP connections routed over the firewall or
+router on which it is run.
+.br
+.SH WARNING
+.B Cutter 
+has been designed for use as a administrators tool for Linux
+firewalls. It's use (as is, or modified) for any other purpose is not
+sanctioned by the author. So - do not use this tool as a parachute, or
+to dry your cat, chill meat, answer your phone, drive you car, teach
+your kids to read or attack other people's computer systems or networks.
+.PP
+This software has been designed for 
+.I legal 
+and 
+.I appropriate 
+use
+by network security administrators and the like. It has been written as
+part of a larger Linux firewall project, targetting at controlling traffic
+from peer-to-peer software such as Kazaa, iMesh and others into and out of
+a private network. It is not designed as a tool for malicious use and the
+author in no way sanctions such use.
+.PP
+Users of the software should be aware that it's actions are easily detectable
+using a number of readily available network monitoring tools, and it makes no
+attempt to disguise it's actions. Malicious use of "cutter" could result in a
+jail sentance in a number of countries around the world.
+.PP
+The author is not responsible for the results of using this software. It
+is provided "as is" in the hope that it will be useful, but no garantees
+are made about it's use.
+.br
+.SH USAGE
+.B Cutter
+can be called using one of the following four syntaxes.
+
+.BI cutter \ ip-address
+
+.B Example: 
+.RS
+.br
+.BI cutter \ 10.10.0.45
+
+Cuts all connections
+passing through the firewall
+between any ports on the specified ip-address (either a "private" or
+"public" address) and any other hosts. This can be used to close down
+all incoming connections to a particular server, all outgoing
+connections from a particular client or all outgoing connections to a
+server.
+.RE
+
+.B cutter 
+.I ip-address port
+
+.B Example: 
+.RS
+.br
+.B cutter 
+.I 200.1.2.3 80
+
+Cuts all connections to or from the
+specified ip-address/port pair. This allows the user to be a little more
+specific than the previous example and allows targetting of specific
+services on specific hosts.
+.RE
+
+.B cutter 
+.I ip-address-1 port-1 ip-address-2
+
+.B Example: 
+.RS
+.br
+.B cutter 
+.I 200.1.2.3 22 10.10.0.45
+
+Cuts all connections between
+ip-address-2 and ip-address-1/port-1. This allows the user to cut
+connections between a specified "client" and a particular service on a
+specified host. Our example closes host 10.10.0.45's SSH connection to
+server 200.1.2.3.
+.RE
+
+.B cutter 
+.I ip-address-1 port-1 ip-address-2 port-2
+
+.B Example: 
+.RS
+.br
+.B cutter 
+.I 200.1.2.3 22 10.10.0.45 32451
+
+Cuts the specific connection between
+the two ip/port number pairs given.
+.RE
+.SH STATUS
+Cutter 1.03 should be considered 
+.B EXPERIMENTAL. 
+The author is releasing a
+tool that works on the systems he has access to (namely: IPCop and
+RedHat Linux), and he is seeking input on it's use on other systems,
+ideas for improvement, offers of sponsorship - etc.
