  Candy Crisis is an exciting combination of pure action and puzzle gaming! The
  game features twelve unique stages, complete with its own character and
  individual technique. Also, you can pair off against a friend, and even
  specify a handicap so that both players are evenly matched. And if you don't
  want to play against an opponent, Solitaire Crisis mode allows you to practice
  without having to compete against an opponent. A tutorial is included with the
  game as well, so even puzzle novices can become Candy Crisis champions in no
  time.
