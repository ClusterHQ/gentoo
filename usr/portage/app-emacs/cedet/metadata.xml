  CEDET is a collection of tools written with the end goal of creating an
  advanced development environment. Emacs already is a great environment for
  writing software, but there are additional areas that need improvement.
  Many new ideas for integrated environments have been developed in newer
  products, such as Microsoft's Visual environment. CEDET is a new project
  which brings together the various tools built to replicate these features.

  Major Components of CEDET:
   * SpeedBar
   * EmacsLispObjects (EIEIO)
   * SemanticBovinator
   * ConnectedGraphEditor (COGRE)
   * Makefile Generation and Project Management (EDE)
