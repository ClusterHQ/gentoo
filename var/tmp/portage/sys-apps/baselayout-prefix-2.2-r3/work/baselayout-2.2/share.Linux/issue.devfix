-----------------------------------------------------
Your system seems to be missing critical device files 
in /dev !  Although you may be running udev or devfs, 
the root partition is missing these required files !

To rectify this situation, please do the following:
mkdir /mnt/fixit
mount --bind / /mnt/fixit
cp -a --remove-destination /dev/* /mnt/fixit/dev/
umount /mnt/fixit
rmdir /mnt/fixit

You may refer to these instructions at /etc/issue.  
If you previously had an issue file, it has been 
backed up at /etc/issue.devfix.  Once you've fixed 
your system, you will have to restore your old issue 
file in order to get rid of this warning.

Thanks for using Gentoo ! :)
