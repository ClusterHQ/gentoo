# This file defines the filesystems search order used by a
# 'mount -t auto' command.

# Uncomment the following line if your modular kernel has vfat
# support and you want mount to try vfat.
#vfat

# Keep the last '*' intact as it directs mount to use the
# filesystems list available at /proc/filesystems also.
# Don't remove it unless you REALLY know what you are doing!
